# Root Routine Guide
Once Vrooli is functional, the first routine that must be added is the root routine, as every other routine is a child (or grandchild, or great grandchild, etc.) of it. The root routine's function is to complete any task, which makes it more theoretical than an actual executable routine. Nonetheless, providing some basic structure to the root routine on launch will act as a resource for new users, and hopefully a source of inspiration for what Vrooli can become in the future.

This is an active document that serves as a personal reference for how the initial root routine should be created, and what data will be added to the subroutines. As I go through the steps to contributing to Project Catalyst, I will update this guide with what I've learned.

## 1. Write down your idea!
An idea may sound great in your head, but it cannot become a great idea until it has been recorded in a comprehensible format. A short description may contain enough data for *you* to understand your own idea, but it is likely not enough information for *others* to understand what you're blabbering about. Writing is also one of the best ways to organize your thoughts, so this exercise will give your more clarity on what it is you're trying to create.

It is logical to assume that, the fewer sentences required to explain your idea comprehensibly, the easier it will be for people to contribute. The big question is, how can we maximize the time spent conveying your idea? Here are a few areas of interest, in increasing difficulty:  
- Templates and guidelines - The simplest way to reduce work is by saving users from the worry of formatting and layout of documents.
- Describing the context of your idea by where it belongs in the root routine - This gives context on the users and utility of your idea, so you don't have to.
- Using language models to convert unstructured notes into a readable format

## 2. Find existing projects
Now that you're clear on what you're trying to create, it is a good time to check if your idea isn't so original after all. Luckily, Vrooli is a great resource for this. A manual routine for certifying that you checked Vrooli is a good solution here. If you really wanted to get fancy, an AI could check Vrooli for you. That would be a useful feature at some point (such as when AIs themselves are submitting ideas), but is not that important for now.

## 3. Protect your idea
An optional step (that can be returned to later) is to mint your idea as an NFT. This can be used as evidence to show when you came up with the idea. Future research will be conducted to determine if this NFT can be used to transfer an entire DAO between users (so it essentially acts as a title of ownership of the business)

## 4. Share your initial idea
Before attempting to determine if an idea is useful by yourself, why not share it with the community? Contructive feedback is always a great thing to receive. Places your idea can be shared (depending on what the idea is) are:  
- on social media
- Project Catalyst insights
- subreddits
- StackOverflow
- survey sites

A routine that gives users a quick questionnaire to decide where they should post their idea seems like the easiest solution

## 5. Represent your idea
All businesses need a way to represent themselves. This is accomplished through Discord servers, GitHub READMEs, social medias, and websites. Most of this routine is simple, except for the website generation. Depending on the type of business, website needs will vary. I picture the evolution of this subroutine as follows:  
1. Website templates that can be cloned from GitHub. Either hire a developer to customize it for you, or try to make the changes yourself. This is assuming that your needs are out of scope for something like Shopify or Webflow.
2. Templates + Copilot will open up this step to some tech-savvy non-developers
3. Built-in auto-generating UI. Specify the pages and contents of the pages, and Vrooli creates an interface that matches the user's preferences. If this approach is taken, the business's services will be baked into Vrooli, so their business website only needs to contain the typical landing page, about page, etc. If they want their business to be available outside of Vrooli, they'd still have to develop it as normal.

## 6. Start looking for a team
By sharing and representing your idea, you may have already started finding team members. If you're still looking for more paid and non-paid members, this step guides you through the process.

## 7. Refine and further desribe your idea
Use the community's feedback to refine your idea. Continue refining your idea as you create a timeline, business plan, technical documents, etc.
