Choose **WALLET** if you are on a browser with the [Nami](https://namiwallet.io/) extension. This will not cost any money, but requires the signing of a message to verify that you own the wallet. Wallets will be utilized in the future to support user donations and execute routines tied to smart contracts.

Choose **EMAIL** if you are on mobile or do not have a Nami account. A wallet can be associated with your account later.

Choose **ENTER AS GUEST** if you only want to view the site or execute existing routines.
