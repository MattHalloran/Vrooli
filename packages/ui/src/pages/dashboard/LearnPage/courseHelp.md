Courses are community-created projects, each designed to teach a specific skill. Any project associated with the "learn" tag will be listed here.

In the long term, we would like to be able to generate digital certificates for completing courses. These certificates would be issued on [Atala Prism](https://atalaprism.io/app). The legitimacy of a certificate would be generated through a [web-of-trust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_of_trust).
