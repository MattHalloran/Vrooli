The **Learn Dashboard** is designed to help you achieve your goals of self-actualization and self-improvement. 

Currently, the page is bare-bones. It contains a section to pin your learning resources, and lists of popular courses and tutorials.

If you are not logged in, default learning resources will be displayed.

In the future, we will add many new learning features, such as:  
- [Atala Prism](https://atalaprism.io/app) certifications to courses, so you can display your skills
- The ability to set time and skill-based goals for learning, with reminders to keep you on track
